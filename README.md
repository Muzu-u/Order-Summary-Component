### Links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt about media queries so I can apply some custom style depending on the screen size. This background changing for example:
```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    body{
        background-image: url("../images/pattern-background-mobile.svg");
    }
}
```
I also learnt about SVG managing, and what I consider MOST important, I practiced and recap my web development knowledge; I applied concepts that I had seen, and it might not be my best job, but I'm happy with how it all turned out.

### Continued development

I've got to continue learning about CSS Grid until I'm confident using it, so I can move forward to flexbox or some other CSS tools.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me on changing the background image depending on the screen size.
